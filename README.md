This is a project for applying `machine learning` to airbnb `Boston Airbnb data`

* Question 1: How many listings are in the neighbourhood and where are they? Identifies all the listings and availability in the Boston based on the AirBnB data provided.  
* Question 2: Does seasonality influence prices and room availabiltity? Identifies seasonality in the data - listings and prices by assesssing the impact of labour day- end of summer and start of school on Airbnb availaibile listings and prices. 
* Question 3 Which properties or features of the listing are associated with high prices? Find the average price of each type of accomodation based on bedroom classes - 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom and 3 bedroom plus. Also explored the price verse various features such as 'number of bedrooms','room_type', 'bed_type', 'bathrooms','accommodates','review_scores_rating', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'host_response_time', "minimum_nights", 'maximum_nights','clean_cleaning_fee'. 
* Question 4 Can we predict the price with those features to inform new hosts? Used the features expolored, that is, ['bedrooms','room_type', 'bed_type', 'bathrooms','accommodates','review_scores_rating', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'host_response_time', "minimum_nights", 'maximum_nights','clean_cleaning_fee'] to predict the price of new lisitngs.

    "# This is why your next boston vacation(AirBnB) will be cheaper! \n",

    "+ A cruise along Charles river, New England acquarium, Boston Red Sox games, Freedom Trail tour of revolutionary Boston and Harvard University Campus guided walking are amongst the exciting adventures the historic city, Boston, offers its callers. But how about having these romantic experience without breaking the bank? if that was your fear, you are in luck because you are just about getting the insider scope for the best Airbnb vacation homes in this historic city. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Boston is one of the oldest states in the USA although it has kept it charm and younth all through the changing seasons. From vibrant night life, brisk business activities during the day, and its youthful college population, Boston has it all - fun, lesuire, hisotry, and a taste of the finiest cusines. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ With all these offerings, one shouldnt be surprise that Boston is a popular destination whose seasons are not only influence by elements of nature (vagraies of the weather) but by many other factors such as school calender, sporting events, and major holidays. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Boston has 3585 Airbnb properties of which about 50% are evenly dispersed amongst its top six locations: Jamaica Plain(10%), South End(9%), Back Bay(8%), Fenway(8%), Dorchester(8%), and Allston(7%). The second half seems be evenly spread amongst the remaining listings, with the top 45% being shared proportionately (3-5%) by the remaining hosts. This suggests a fairly competitive market with no dominant player and as such the Airbnb offerings could expereince some price elasticity, with diffferential offerings (features) driving the price. Refer to Fig 1.0 for the full listings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It appears most of the listings are centrally located and are near downtown Boston. This could be expalined by the fact that Boston is a college city and doubles as a financial services hub with lots of business travellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does seasonality impact the prices of these lisitng? \n",
    "\n",
    "+ One will ask, is there a best time to visit Boston?  Just like anything else, the market forces of supply and demand impacts the price of the Airbnb listings in Boston. From all indications, it appears that the Fall and Summer (March to August) are the best times to visit Boston. During this period, the weather in Boston is not only pleasant, but the sun shines on your pocket too as a tourist. The airbnb listings availability is fairly high (about 50k lisitngs) with average price range of $172 - $175, with the price spike of about 15% to $195 in September and October window and plataus at about $180 in the November to January period. The price then start its decent in February into the Fall and Summer seasons. ( It appears there are three seasons in the Boston data: The high season - August to November, the mid season - Novemebr to January and the Low season - from February to July.)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It appears that the price of the vacation homes is influenced by supply and demand factors and seasonality as witnessed by the low invesntory in Septemebr / October school calender commanding higher prices suggesting strong seansonality that influence the number of available listings which correlates with the price. Additionally, the seasonal demands in December/January holidays also commands higer prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (The average price of Airbnb listings skyrockets in September/October window to about >$192, when listings are lowest - 35k as seen in Fig 2.0.   Fig 3.0 also confirms this assertion that as inventory drops to 35k, the price jumps to about $195 and price drops as inventory increases to about 55k and then begins to rise again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property features that are associated with higher prices \n",
    "\n",
    "+ From the analysis of the Airbnb data, it appears that the type of property (entire home/apartment, private room and shared room) and bedroom calss (upto 1 bedroom ($189), 2bedrooms($259), 3bedrooms($316), and 3bedroom plus($400)) are key drivers of the price. The 1bedrooms starts at average price of $189 and graduates to $400 for the entire homes/apartment with over 3bedrooms. If one is open to sharing common areas with a private bedroom, the average price $96 and $92 if one is open to sharing the bedroom. \n"
